# Building a power analysis tool from the ground up

- [liberty file format](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/publications/other/liberty07_03.pdf)

## Leakage power

- The very first step here is to see if we obtain the static power analysis that Genus provides after synthesis
    - Obtain a gate level netlist from Genus by going through synthesis
    - See if we can map it into a BLIF file by using Yosys & parse it using the blif parser
    - Parse the liberty file of the standard cell library (liberty file is for a particular temp & voltage)
    - Add all the leakage power values from the lib file and compare it with what Genus reports
    - [liberty file example](https://github.com/erihsu/liberty2json/blob/main/examples/latch_cell.lib#L8)
        - If I look into a example liberty file, it seems like the `leakage_power` field actually depends on the input values of a standard cell
        - Can having different input values slightly change the cell circuit characteristics so that the leakage power is altered?
        - If this is truly the case, leakage power estimation may not be as easy as summing numbers from the liberty file?

## Dynamic power

- Dynamic power is induced by the switching of transistors causing capacitors to drain/fill
- The first order approach
    - Parse the VCD from RTL simulation to obtain the switching activity of each signal
    - From the liberty file we can obtain the capacitance of each gate
    - We need to find correlation points in between the gate level netlist and the RTL (to propagate switching activity). This may not be straightforward...
    - Some math to compute the dynamic power (seems like we can just use the `fall_capacitance` and `rise_capacitance`?)

## Glitching power

- Now things become a bit more tricky as we have to perform timing annotated gate level simulation
- This requires a event driven simulation framework to be built (separate section on the event driven simulation framework)
- But assuming that we have the event driven simulation framework and can initialize the simulation using the results from RTL sim, we can now estimate glitching power
- `internal_power` field in the liberty file
    - Describes the power consumed during transitions
    - The `rise_power` and `fall_power` tables provide values for power consumption during rising and falling transitions
    - Indexed by input transition times and output load capacitances

## Event driven simulation framework

### Building a reference from VCS

### Building the main event driven gate level simulation framework

- Read the following two papers to understand the general concept of gate level sim & power estimation
    - [GATSPI](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2022-03_gatspi-gpu-accelerated-gate-level-simulation-power-improvement)
    - [Grannite](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2020-07_grannite-graph-neural-network-inference-transferable-power-estimation)
    - [basic techniques of gate level simulation](https://lume.ufrgs.br/bitstream/handle/10183/126714/000103176.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)
        - Describes datastructures and considerations when it comes to implementing a timing-annotated gate level simulation framework
            - **Read chapters 7, 9, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4**
- Generate a netlist using [yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys)
- Parse the generated netlist [blif-parser](https://github.com/ucb-bar/blif-parser)
- Parse liberty files to obtain the gate level delay [liberty-parse](https://crates.io/crates/liberty-parse)
- Implement timing-annotated gate level simulation framework

- Start with a GCD

```
// GCD.sv
// Generated by CIRCT firtool-1.62.0
module GCD(
  input        clock,
               reset,
  input  [1:0] io_value1,
               io_value2,
  input        io_loadingValues,
  output [1:0] io_outputGCD,
  output       io_outputValid
);

  reg [1:0] x;
  reg [1:0] y;
  always @(posedge clock) begin
    if (io_loadingValues) begin
      x <= io_value1;
      y <= io_value2;
    end
    else if (x > y)
      x <= x - y;
    else
      y <= y - x;
  end // always @(posedge)
  assign io_outputGCD = x;
  assign io_outputValid = y == 2'h0;
endmodule
```

- You can install Yosys using conda: [yosys feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/yosys-feedstock)
- Some Yosys commands to parse & perform techmapping

```
read_verilog GCD.sv
hierarchy -check -top GCD
proc; opt; memory; opt; fsm; opt; techmap; opt;
write_blif GCD.blif
```

- Parse the `GCD.blif` file and you can obtain a gate level netlist
- Parse the liberty file
- Given a input stimuli (can be a input file containing the input values for a particular cycle), write a simulator that can perform event driven simulation
    - Essentially implement the 2D linked list datastructure in "basic techniques of gate level simulation"
